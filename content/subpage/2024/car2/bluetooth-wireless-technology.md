      Quick Tips:


      * If the Smart Key battery is weak or not working properly, hold the Smart
      Key fob up to the ENGINE START/STOP button (Lock button side closest) and
      press to start engine

      * The Smart Key's signal can be blocked by the normal operation of a cell
      or smartphone. To help prevent this, store each device separately

      * When reinserting the mechanical key into the fob, make sure it is pushed
      all the way in until there is a click sound
